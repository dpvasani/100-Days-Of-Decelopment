## Introduction

The **30-Days-Of-Development** repository is aimed at developers who want to gain a solid understanding of React and advance their skills. This repository is divided into two sections: foundational projects that introduce basic concepts, and intermediate projects that dive deeper into more complex topics. By working through these projects, you'll build a robust understanding of React's core features and learn how to apply them in real-world scenarios.

## Projects

### React-Foundation Projects
